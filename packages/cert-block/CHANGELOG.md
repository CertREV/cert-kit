# Changelog — @certrev/cert-block

The cert card is a **design-locked** component. Semver contract: **patch and minor releases never
change the rendered cert output and never break a compiling integration** (registration surface,
exports, types). Anything that would alter what a visitor sees — or require integration changes —
is announced loudly here first.

## 0.5.3 — 2026-07-22

- **New:** `certRevCertComponent` (`./builder`) — the drop-in gen2 registration entry, with the
  mutable `inputs[]` the SDK's `RegisteredComponent` type expects:
  `customComponents={[...yourComponents, certRevCertComponent]}`. One import, no re-wrapping, no
  readonly spread. `BUILDER_REGISTRATION` (the readonly canonical view) is unchanged.
- **New:** the 19 exporter-populated wire inputs are marked `advanced` — the Builder editor's
  Options tab now leads with the two placement inputs (`mode`, `part`) and tucks the
  system-populated fields under "Advanced". Editor-cosmetic only.
- **Changed:** `@certrev/cert-contract` moved from a peer dependency (`>=0.5.0`, unbounded) to a
  regular dependency (bounded `^0.5.0`) — a plain `npm i @certrev/cert-block` is a complete
  install regardless of the consumer's peer-install settings, and a future contract 0.6 can no
  longer float in unreviewed.
- **Docs:** README rewritten for the gen2 SDK (`customComponents` array) — the previous README
  showed the gen1 `Builder.registerComponent` API and pre-publish notes that no longer applied
  (the contract package and the modal bundle both ship for real since 0.5.x). Added in-package
  modal instructions (`?url` import + external script + literal CSP allowances), a known-issues
  note (`@builder.io/sdk-react@5.2.4` types under `moduleResolution: nodenext`), and this
  changelog.
- Rendered output: **byte-identical to 0.5.2** (changes outside the registration surface are
  comment-only).

## 0.5.2 — 2026-07-21

- Republish of 0.5.1 (the 0.5.1 GitHub-Packages tarball was unfetchable). No code changes.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-07

- `./modal/placement` subpath exposed (the side-effect-free placement engine).

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07

- The certificate-modal Web Component moved **into** the package (POR-10721 W2): prebuilt
  dependency-free IIFE at `./modal/certrev-cert.js` (byte-parity with the deployed theme-extension
  asset) + the `./modal` subpath. Banner memo placement (`part`), font hook, static preview block.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07

- Render strictly from `placedFields` + `renderCustomFace`; v2 brand-ink theming
  (`barInk` / `inkColor`).

## 0.3.0 and earlier

- The locked 3-mode `renderCertBlock` faces, re-synced to the final Liquid design; the
  ambient-URL anchor model (`CertRevAnchor`, zero-input); the initial React components, JSON-LD
  projector, fail-closed verify layer, and `<certrev-badge>` Web Component.
